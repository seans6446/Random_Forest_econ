Compares VAR with RF for rGDP I(1) forecast
This Rmd compares the Mean Squared Error obtained from a Vector Autoregression to the order of 3, versus a Random Forest evaluation and forecast of real Gross Domestic Product of the United States of America. The test set is 20% of the sample, and the training set comprises the rest. Implications of this result are pertinent to the future application of data science to economic and financial time-series.
Data is attached in a zip file, obtained from the St.Louis Fed (FRED, available at https://fred.stlouisfed.org/).
Does a RF beat a VAR? Spoiler alert: No.
